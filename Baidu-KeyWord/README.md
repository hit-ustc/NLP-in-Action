#About Project

This repository mainly records in the process of the [Baidu Campus competitions](http://openresearch.baidu.com/online/artical.do?method=activityItemDetail&activityID=26eb630e-5839-452d-ad71-bf023a8d6327&navIndex=1). The repository is only for learn to study, without any commercial use. 

I this project, it is mainly extracted keywords from the sentences. I use the following algorithms:

1. TF-IDF
2. TextRank


Now, the match is still on. I learned a lot from it. Thanks to Baidu for providing this platform.

Of course, there are many mistakes and shortcomings, we can learn and progress together, thank you!
